Plans and ideas(*):
BACKEND:
- Have two seperate ways to access the site, one with no authorization and and one with a login to gain more personalized recommendation of music 
- Implement all artist and track methods
- Implement the search bar
- Differentiate whether a loggedin page appears or a non loggedin page appears (most likely need two different routes for "/loggedin/tracks" and just "/tracks")

FRONTEND:
Proposed layout:

LANDING PAGE- A simple page that will offer a few things
	LANDING PAGE CONTENT - The initial landing page should show off the title of the website in a big font. Going for "music recs" for now
		- Maybe some subtext saying something along the lines of 
		  "Search right here for a specific artist or track OR login above to get your artists and tracks from your spotify profile"
		-
	SEARCH - A searchbar somewhere which will allow a user to search up a specific artists or tracks
	LOGIN - A login button on the main page that will prompt the spotify authorization and redirect to a loggedin page which will show some sort of personalization
		- AFTER LOGIN: Maybe be greeted with Hello {username}! and something like "your top artists and tracks of the month" 
		-FAILED LOGIN: Display text saying the login has failed, wait a few seconds, and then redirect to the main page


TWO SEPERATE PAGES( maybe more*)
/tracks and /artists for now, Since the front end is in React, no need to reload the page, so there will most likely be a navigation bar on either the side or the top of the landing page

These pages will vary on whether or not the user is logged in or not so I will most likely have different information dispalyed on both
	/tracks - /tracks page itself is most likely going to show something like Top 10 tracks in {your_country} 
			- any clicks on a specific track on the tracks page will direct to tracks/<track_id> (see INDIVUDIUAL ARTIST AND TRACKS)


	/artists- /artists page itself is most likely going to show something like Top 10 artists in {your_country}
			-any clicks on a specific track on the tracks page will direct to artists/<artist_id> (see INDIVUDIUAL ARTIST AND TRACKS)

	/loggedin/tracks - present a song and a preview and asks if the user likes it (maybe with a thumbs up/down icon*)
			- display the song title, artist name, album cover,  
			- Add an add to playlist button
			- First song will use spotify's recommendation algorithm using the current user's top 5 songs and top 5 artists as seeds
			- After the user rates, highlight the selection (green on the thumbs up, red for thumbs down)we can continue to iterate through all of the recommendations 
			  (next and previous buttons should exist) that came with the first recommendation, after that, when the user reaches the end, they can press a refresh button 
			  where we can use what songs were rated positively as the new seeds. Additionally, we can throw user's recently listened to, into the mix (optional)

	/loggedin/artists - same idea as loggedin/tracks but with artists
				- In order to keep the artists fresh on refresh, we can use a mix of what artists the user is following, or what artists the user has recently listened to

INDIVUDIUAL ARTIST AND TRACKS
On click of an artist or track it will bring up a page for that specific artist or track that will be able to display much information, such as
	tracks/<track_id>:
	- Specifc Track info 
	- Related tracks
	- *SOLID IDEA* Pull any extra information I can using genuis.com, whether through webscraping or if they have an API

	artists/<artist_id>:
	- Retreive artist albums
	- Top artist tracks
	- Retrieve artists social media and other links if possible
